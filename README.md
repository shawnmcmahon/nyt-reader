## Overview

The mission for this project was to build to a New York Times News Reader app within 8 hours. The application utilizes the New York Times Top Stories API. Users can pick from a selection of Top Story categories and see a summary view of the top stories from that day. Each summary leads to a detailed article view where more information is available about that story. User's are able to navigate to that New York Times article directly from the app to read the entire story. 

# Learning Goals
  * Create a functional news reader app within 8 hours
  * Build upon the foundational skills of React  
  * Utilizes React Router for url navigation
  * Implement client-side testing with Cypress
